# Xcos on Web
Xcos is an open source graphic simulator available with Scilab. Scilab can be installed on all major Operating Systems

The main aim of this project will be to port core functionalities of Xcos to a browser-only version that can be used without installing additional plugins or software on the cloud.

2. Then go into `scilab` folder and run following commands:

	`make`

3. Then run `SendLog.py` from `xcos-on-web` folder to host the xcos on localhost i.e. `127.0.0.1:8001/`
